    "#### The goals for this class are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The first things students should do, if they didn't finish this in the last class period, is to get their forward Euler solution working.\n",
    "* Once they have that working, they should try implementing the midpoints (RK2) method. This is the bare minimum goal for the assignment. If they don't have much time left once they get midpoint working, they should be encouraged to move on to the end of the assignment without implementing RK 4.\n",
    "* Time permitting, they should see if they can also get the RK 4 method working.\n",
    "* At the end of the assignment, the main goal is to have student experiment with the differences in the numerical solutions when they use the same time step for different methods. They should find that Euler requires a smaller time step to converge to the same solution as midpoint method or RK 4. They should also spend some time thinking about why they would use one method over another.\n",
    "\n",
    "**IMPORTANT NOTE**: When this assignment was run for the first time during Fall 2019, students got really confused with the mathematical notation for Midpoint Method and the RK4 method. If one had the time, it would be useful to think about how to better represent the mathematics to simplify the implementation process."
