The video only mentions two possible methods for solving an ordinary differential equation, the Euler Method and the Midpoint Method, but there are actually a number of different methods for solving such equations. One class of these methods are the Runge-Kutta methods. You should spend some time reading the following link to learn a bit more about the \"RK4\" method.\n",
