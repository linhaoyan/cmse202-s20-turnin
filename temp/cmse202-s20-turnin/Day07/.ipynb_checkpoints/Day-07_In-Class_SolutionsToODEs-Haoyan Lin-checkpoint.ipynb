The disease that you choose impacts the rate at which a person becomes infected, how long they are infected for, and how easily they spread the disease to others in the population. In order to pick a disease, you may want to read more about something called the [basic reproduction number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_reproduction_number) and see how it relates to the rates involved in your set of ODEs. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Add a compartment.**\n",
    "Your model needs to contain a minimum of three compartments and a maximum of five. At least one of the compartments needs to be different from the existing S, I, and R. On the Wikipedia page for the [SIR model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compartmental_models_in_epidemiology#The_SIR_model) there are examples of variations which you can explore to get ideas from. No matter what the compartment the group adds is, you all must provide justifications and reasoning for why it makes sense to add the compartment with your chosen disease. For example, you would not want to use the same model for measles and the flu since those diseases do not behave in the same ways. "
