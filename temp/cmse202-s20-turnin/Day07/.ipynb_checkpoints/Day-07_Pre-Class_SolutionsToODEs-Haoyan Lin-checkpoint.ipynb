The disease that you choose impacts the rate at which a person becomes infected, how long they are infected for, and how easily they spread the disease to others in the population.

On the Wikipedia page for the [SIR model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compartmental_models_in_epidemiology#The_SIR_model) there are examples of variations which you can explore to get ideas from. No matter what the compartment the group adds is, you all must provide justifications and reasoning for why it makes sense to add the compartment with your chosen disease. For example, you would not want to use the same model for measles and the flu since those diseases do not behave in the same ways. "
