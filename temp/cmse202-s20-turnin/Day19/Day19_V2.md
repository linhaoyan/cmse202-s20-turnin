## Work on Projects

Due to the this situation this semester, it may be harder to communicate with your group. Please take the time you would normally spend on the pre-class assignment and contact your groups. On the class for Day 20 (Monday or Tuesday), each group will be giving a brief update. For this presentation (3-5 minutes in length) you will need to:

1. Briefly describe the project goal
2. Mention who will be responsible for which parts of the project.

Remember that the project check point is due Monday 3/30 and for this you will need to have:

1. Created a shared github repo for your group
2. Posted a file (txt, pdf, markdown) answering the questions specified per previous directions
