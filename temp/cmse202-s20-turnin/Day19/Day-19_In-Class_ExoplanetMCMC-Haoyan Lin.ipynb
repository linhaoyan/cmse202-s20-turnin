    "## Problem Description\n",
    "\n",
    "In the D2L directory for Day 19, along with this notebook, you should see a file called '51_Pegasi_RadVel.dat'. This file contains radial velocity data (which is the line-of-sight velocity) for a star called \"51 Pegasi\", a star located in the Pegasus constellation. This radial velocity data indicates that the star is \"wobbling\" towards and away from us as we look at it. This stellar wobble is actually a sign that there is another relatively massive object orbiting the star and gravititational pulling it around (see the image above). In fact, this star happens to be home to the first extrasolar planet ever observed around a main-sequence star (a star that currently fusing hydrogen into helium in it's core much like our Sun). This planet was originally given the very original name of \"[51 Pegasi b](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/51_Pegasi_b)\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Astronomers were able to observe that there is a planet orbiting 51 Pegasi through a method referred to as [Doppler Spectroscopy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doppler_spectroscopy). Basically, if you can measure the radial velocity \"wobbles\" of the star and you understand a bit about orbital mechanics, you can fit a model to the data and determine the properties of the object that is causing the wobbles. You're going to do this in-class today. And you're going to do it using the MCMC method we learned in the last class period!\n",
    "\n",
    "(Side note: it turns out that one of the previous CMSE 202 instructors has a bit of experience with [modeling the orbits of stars and using MCMC methods to estimate parameters](http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/588545/meta). Clearly this topic was chosen by coincidence.)\n",

    "2. Take a (potential) \"step\" from $(W_0, I_0)$ in a random direction to produce $(W_1, I_1)$\n",

    "4. Calculate an acceptance probability, $P = e^{-\\chi_1^2}/e^{-\\chi_0^2}$, as the ratio of two *likelihood functions* (the exponentials).\n",
    "5. Uniformly generate a random number $r \\in [0, 1)$. If $r < P$, \"accept\" $(W_1, I_1)$ as the next initial guess. Otherwise, discard $(W_1, I_1)$ and generate a new potential step from $(W_0, I_0)$.\n",
